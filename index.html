                      For this governmental customer Accessle unlocked a 25 year
                      old windows application still in use. The target was their
                      enterprise service bus (ESB). The connection was
                      established in a day. By unlocking vital information of
                      previous cliëntele these became accessable again for the
                      business processes of this customer, without the tedious
                      work of synchronizing by hand.

                      This customer was confronted with SaaS use by a business
                      unit that was not authorized by the IT department. The
                      result was that the data was not integrated with other
                      applications of the company. Accessle made a temporally
                      solution that synchronized two applications. So the
                      naughty department didn't lose time and the data was
                      available for the other parts of the company. After a
                      while the illegal SaaS was substituted with something
                      integrated in the architecture.

                      This case involves a city in Europe that used a CMS that
                      was made twenty something years ago. The company that
                      serviced it filed for bankruptcy. This left this city with
                      no means to move to a more modern CMS. Accessle helpt them
                      by getting the content and add it to a new CMS. After the
                      migration, the old CMS could finally be decommisioned.

                      A customer made a Delphi application, but as time moved on
                      this application was harder and harder to maintain. So it
                      was decided to make a new more modern version. Accessle
                      helped with migrating data from the old application to the
                      new one. This meant that the customer's scarce project
                      resources were available for building the new application.

                      A Dutch municipality needed to have their data migrated

                      involved address data and a little bit of history.
                      Accessle provided a means with less effort than building a
                      export function in the old application. Saving time and
                      money by facilitating a project that was completed in time
                      and on budget.
